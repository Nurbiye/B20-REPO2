THIS IS MY 4RTH FILE

second way:
drag and drop 



if everything in user shows up in github desk top, i can go to the terminal, check git status, if there are a bunch of stuff, i can use     "rm -rf .git"          to delete accidental repo at root user folder. (it means whole my computer under my user name in under control version )
